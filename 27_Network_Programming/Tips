0. Network programming with python
1. socket works on client server architecture model
2. to get self ip address to setup or initiate server dynamically is as follows
	
	import socket
	HEADER = 64
	SERVER = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
	PORT = 5050
	FORMAT = 'utf-8'

3. socket object initiation and server host port binding
	
	server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	server.bind((SERVER, PORT))

4. Active threads to count in a python program
	
	threadsExcludingCurrentOne = threading.activeCount() -1

5. blocking lines of codes that must run under a thread for not to block other clients
	
	SocketConnection, address = server.accept()
	..
	Message = SocketConnection.recv(NumberOfBytesToRead).decode(FORMAT)

6. Define a header length for specified protocol on TCP socket to know the message length
   of the client to receive from . On each connection read the header size data then read message of the given size received from client.

7. Track client disconnection to ensure safe reconnect of the client

8. check received message length every time to over sure that what you are expecting and
   want to parshe

9. Multi threading . Set the thread Object and daemon=True to release memory after the
   parent is closed

   		t = threading.Thread(target=example,args=(exampleParams))
   		t.daemon = True
   		t.start()

11.Proxy Server , Redirect Server
12.In SIP , 100 --> Trying, 180 --> Ringing, 200 --> OK,
